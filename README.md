# Project

This readme file can help you go thru my shiny app.

The app is used to find out what kind of iris you have. A machine learning algorithm is embedded in the server using boosting.

The data set is the standard iris data from r.

On the left panel, you can input the key measurements of your flower in the numeric input bars. Some sample data are provided on the 
lower left side. If you have no idea what a sepal or a petal is, then you may refer the picture on the upper right. The result is updated
in the lower right side. Be patient the webpage may take few seconds to load all the necessary packages. Enjoy it!



### Thank you and have a good day:)
